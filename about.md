Hello! I'm Isabel, from Bejar, one of the most beautiful (and small ;P ) towns to lose yourself. Currently I live in Madrid.

I enjoy doing, I love to try ideas, learn, discover and always try to go a little further.

I have leaded technological projects on automation of operational planning, both human and material resources using prescriptive analytical techniques (mathematical optimization). I have enjoyed applying agile software development methodologies, always trying to improve and working in incredible teams.

I can not imagine my work without looking for innovative ways to make it, from small things, because by quoting Galeano:
> "Mucha gente pequeña en lugares pequeños, haciendo cosas pequeñas pueden cambiar el mundo."

And above all, I do not like to watch things happen, I need to get my hands dirty: develop and play around. You can see my latest works here, from IoT with Arduino to scaling with Docker through Elastic or UX using Google apis for Javascript. Funny!

I am always open to new opportunities, contact me and let's have a coffee.
